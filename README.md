# Pattern Searching Algorithm
This project was created for the [Software Development Concepts project](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-it/kanban_projects/software-development-concepts) by Codecademy. Technically, the last step in the project was writing the pseudocode, but I figured since it was such a simple algorithm I might as well make an app from it. One can check it on [my portfolio site](https://robiniversen.com/pattern-searching-algorithm)

## Write a Blog Post
As part of the project, one had to write a blog post about the process. If you want to read that, it's on [my site's currently hidden blog section](https://robiniversen.com/blog).

## What the Project Does
It simply searches for a user-specified value inside s larger set of data (that is also user-specified).  

## Why the project is useful
I wouldn't say it's very useful. I mean, there are, for instance, several text editors and browser that have this functionality built-in. But if you had no other way, you could check if you used a specific word to much in a piece of writing. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
